# SINGA achievements

Here is what we want to achieve during the hackathon for SINGA (singa.apache.org):

- Test and document working and not working Docker images.
- Create a Docker Image for Singa 2.0.0.
- List the already implemented loss functions in Singa.
- Implement a new loss function in Python.
