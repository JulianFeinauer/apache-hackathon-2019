# Achievements

## Commits
We made nearly 70 commits (68) during the Hackathon to the ASF Repo.
As some where working in their forks, we assume that we have overall about *100* commits during the Hackathon.
Commits where made from many different people, including PMCs like Christofer, Tim and Julian but also from Community Members like Bj√∂rn and Lukasz and newcommers that where met at the Hackathon like Niklas.
